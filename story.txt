The Klimaanlage at the movie theater was broken
This ruined the Biergarten that I was trying to enjoy at the movies
We went to the ratskellar to enjoy a doener
On the way over to their show I bought a bratwurst.
When we finally arrived in Berlin, the Hund outside the venue judged us silently.
The venue was located in the Schloss off Hauptstrasse.
In the middle of the Schloss there was a beautiful Porsche.
Nearby, a BMW was parked next to the Porsche as if they were fighting for attention.
Suprisingly there was a stall flocking apfelkuchen from a  baeckerei.
We visited Shloss Eltz and took selfies.
The Schloss had no Klimaanlage.
