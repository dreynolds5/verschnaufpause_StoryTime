The Klimaanlage at the movie theater was broken
This ruined the Biergarten that I was trying to enjoy at the movies
We went to the ratskellar to enjoy a doener
On the way over to their show I bought a bratwurst.
When we finally arrived in Berlin, the Hund outside the venue judged us silently.
The venue was located in the Schloss off Hauptstrasse.
In the middle of the Schloss there was a beautiful Porsche.
Nearby, a BMW was parked next to the Porsche as if they were fighting for attention.
Suprisingly there was a stall flocking apfelkuchen from a  baeckerei.
We visited Shloss Eltz and took selfies.
Other influencers showed up and I started to get wettbewerbsfaehig.
The Shloss had no Klimaanlage.
Once we were done sightseeing we got some Gebaeck from a nearby Baeckerei.
Clutching our Bratwurst auf Brot in hand, we ventured onward and on forth, fortified for what lay ahead.
We were excited when Max drove by in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS
Max’s Porsche suddenly stalled on the Hauptstrasse, drawing laughter from the entire crowd.
Thankfully, the repair Hund came to he rescue to save Max from any more embarrassment. 
Right then a guy in Lederhose tripped over a Bratwurst.
So I bought him a new one, and we shared a laugh as crispy as the crust on our Gebäck.
His Lederhose ripped as they were too tight so Max offered the dirndel in his porsche for the guy to wear.
